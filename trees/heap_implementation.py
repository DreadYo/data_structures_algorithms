"""
A heap is a tree where every parent is greater than its children ( for max-heaps )
or they are smaller than their children ( for min-heaps)
A Max heap( and min heap) is typically represented as an array.
The root element will be at Arr[0].
Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node.
Arr[(2*i)+1] Returns the left child node.
Arr[(2*i)+2] Returns the right child node.
Operations on Max Heap (and min heap) include:
 - getMax(): It returns the root element of Max Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
 - extractMax(): Removes the maximum element from MaxHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n)
as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
 - insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree.
If new key is smaller than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything.
Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
Here we are going to implement a max-heap

Lookup      -   O(n)
Insert      -   O(logn)
Delete      -   O(logn)

Binary Heap is very efficient if you need to do some COMPARATIVE operations,
for example to get things (numbers) more than given number.
